# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand-written digits from the **MNIST dataset**.  
The goal is to accurately recognize digits (0‚Äì9) from grayscale images using deep learning techniques with **TensorFlow / Keras** in Python.
